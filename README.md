## Usage

Complete the following steps:

1. Import the `IBMPushNotifications` framework.


	```swift
	import IBMPushNotifications
	```
 >**Note**: For Syndicated use the `overrideServerHost` param of `PushNotifications` before initliazong the `PushNotifications` .  Eg: `PushNotifications.overrideServerHost = "https://syndicated.region.net"`

2. Initialize with details about your IBM Cloud Push Notifications service.

##### Initialize with ApiKey
```swift

    // Initialize PushNotifications
	let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(pushApiKey:"your-push-service-apiKey", pushAppGuid: "your-push-service-app_guid", pushRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH)
	
	// GET AUTH TOKEN
	myPushNotifications?.getAuthToken(completionHandler: { (hasToken, tokenString) in
		if hasToken! {
			// Send push notifications
		}
	})
```

##### Initialize with AppSecret
```swift
	let myPushNotifications = PushNotifications(pushRegion: PushNotifications.Region.US_SOUTH, pushAppGuid: "your-push-service-guid", pushAppSecret: "your-push-service-appSecret")
```

3. Create a simple push notification that will broadcast to all devices.
	
	```swift
	let messageExample = Notification.Message(alert: "Testing IBMPushNotifications")
	let notificationExample = Notification(message: messageExample)
	```
4. Send the Push notification using the method:

	```swift
	myPushNotifications.send(notification: notificationExample) { (data, status, error) in
	  if error != nil {
	    print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
	  }
	}
	```
>**Note**: If you are using the APIKEY for Initialisation kindly call `getAuthToken()` , bofre sending any notification. This will add an Authorization header for the request.

To create a more selective push notification with specified settings that is only sent to certain devices either by `deviceIds` or `userIds` or by device platforms or based on tag-subscriptions, or to set GCM and APNs features - there are optional parameters that you can use in the corresponding intializers.

### Send Bulk push notifications

To send the bulk push notifications of the following ,

```swift
myPushNotifications.sendBulk(notification: [notificationExample,notificationExample1,notificationExample2]) { (data, status, error) in
	  if error != nil {
	    print("Failed to send push notification. Error: \(error!)")
	  }
	}
```
#### Target

In `Target`, you pass the following values:

  * **deviceIds** - Array of device IDs.
  * **userIds** - Array of user IDs.
  * **platforms** - Array of platforms.
  * **tagNames** - Array of tag names.

	  ```swift
	  	let targetExample = Notification.Target(deviceIds: ["device1","device2"],
	         userIds: ["userId1", "userId2"],
	         platforms: [TargetPlatform.Apple,TargetPlatform.Google,TargetPlatform.ChromeExtApp,
	TargetPlatform.WebChrome,TargetPlatform.webFirefox,TargetPlatform.WebSafari], tagNames: ["tag1", "tag2"])
	  ```
>**Note**: Do not use userIds, tagNames, platforms and deviceIds together.

#### Settings

Settings can contain any of the following types:

 * APNs
 * GCM
 * FirefoxWeb
 * ChromeWeb
 * SafariWeb
 * ChromeAppExt

	 ```swift
	 let notificationExample = Notification(message: messageExample,
